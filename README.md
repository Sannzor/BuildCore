# BuildCore

BuildCore is a comprehensive Minecraft plugin designed for Spigot servers (compatible with versions 1.8.x to 1.21.x) that simplifies build location management, teleportation, and server administration. Developed by PingLagger, this plugin provides an intuitive GUI for handling builds, essential admin commands, and a customizable scoreboard to keep players informed.

## Key Features

- **Fully Configurable Build Locations**: Save, manage, and teleport to custom build spots with unique names and item materials (default: PAPER).
- **Easy-to-Use GUI**: Paginated inventory menu for selecting, viewing, and managing builds efficiently.
- **Teleportation Commands**: Quick access to player and coordinate teleports for seamless navigation.
- **Gamemode Switching**: Simple commands to toggle between Creative, Survival, and Spectator modes.
- **Dynamic Scoreboard**: Displays server info, online players, current world, and build location with a blue-and-white theme for better visibility.
- **Full Customization**: All messages, commands, and settings are configurable via `config.yml`. No hard-coded values!
- **Permission System**: Granular permissions for secure usage (e.g., `buildcore.create`, `buildcore.teleport`).

## Commands

- `/builds create <name> [material]` - Save your current location as a build (requires `buildcore.create`).
